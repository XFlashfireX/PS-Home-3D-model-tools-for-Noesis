These are python plugins to be used with Noesis for viewing and exporting 3D models from Playstation Home. As of now, only the model format can be read. I have not implimented anything to read the skeleton and paint weights for models. That is why I've decided to share my work here in hopes someone can improve upon it and make commits to the code.

Installation instructions:

Place the two .py scripts in your noesis/plugins/python folder. That's pretty much it

Things that still need to be done:

Skeleton and animation plugins
